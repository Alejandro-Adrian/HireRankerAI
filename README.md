# 🧠 HireRankerAI – Flask API

This is a modular Flask-based API designed to power intelligent ranking and recommendation workflows. It integrates a locally hosted LLM (Large Language Model) for advanced scoring and decision logic. Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the LLM weights are stored externally and must be downloaded manually.
